    <h1>Best Player on the Toronto Maple Leafs</h1> <br>
    
    <b>Who do you think is the best player on the leafs?</b> <br>
    <br>
    <br>
     <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlAWhcKmOfU">
        Mitch Marner</a></b> <br>
    <p>Is a natural point producer with good skating ability and some versatility in his game. Passes the puck with aplomb and can be an excellent asset on the power play. Raises his level of play in big spots. Is undersized for the professional ranks, so he needs to grow bigger and stronger in order to sustain peek production at the NHL level. Can get knocked off the puck from time to time.</p>

   <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj3K5B9nRO0">
        Auston Matthews</a></b> <br>
    <p>Is an outstanding offensive talent, plus he owns a tremendous frame for the center position. Knows how to use his size to his advantage and is great at protecting and maintaining possession of the puck. His shot is also lethal. Must prove he can physically dominate opponents at the highest level. Also needs to be able to handle tight checking throughout his NHL career. While he has plenty of defensive ability, consistency still eludes him.</p>
    <br>
     <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">
        John Tavares</a></b> <br>
    <p>Boasts the hand/eye coordination, imagination and hockey sense of an offensive stud. Does not shy away from heavy traffic areas, and is a constant top-end threat when roaming around an opponent's goal. Is extremely determined to be the best he can be. Scores goals with a great shot and is also a great passer. Is not nearly as good in the skating department as many of his peers in the National Hockey League. His top-end speed is below-average. Also, he does not play a very physical game, so opponents try to take liberties with him. Can be prone to extensive goal-scoring slumps (though he can contribute in other ways).</p>
